# Tensorflow-Keras-Computer-Vision
This repository contains a host of computer vision projects that I have done using jupyter notebooks, tensorflow, and keras.

Each subfolder will have an explanation of the topic I am researching at the time, and then 1 or more jupyter notebooks where I perform EDA on various data sets and implement/fine-tune existing deep learning models.

Here is an additional photo from the one-stage-object-detection folder where I am able to use YOLOv4 and tensorflow to identify (and bound) myself along with my skis!
